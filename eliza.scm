This file contains Gauche Scheme source code for a simplified version
of the ELIZA conversation program. The code is adapted from Peter
Norvig's code, but many changes have been made to avoid the use of
advanced constructs and to translate Common Lisp to Scheme. To run the
system evaluate all of the code in this file and then evaluate (eliza).
The dialogue may be terminated either by an explicit abort or by
typing "bye" to the Eliza prompt.
